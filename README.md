# 👁️ Eye Disease Detection – Backend API

This is the **backend service** for an Eye Disease Detection system, built using **Python** and designed to handle image inputs for automated classification and diagnosis of common eye diseases using deep learning.

> ⚙️ API logic is implemented in the `app.py` file.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The backend leverages a trained deep learning model to analyze retinal or ocular images and return predictions for possible eye diseases.
The backend file is mainly app.py

### 🔍 Key Features

- 🧾 Upload eye images for diagnosis  
- 📊 Get prediction probabilities for supported diseases  
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight inference pipeline  
- 🌐 Ready for integration with any frontend or mobile application
